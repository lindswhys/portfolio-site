# portfolio-site
A portfolio site project
This was the code for a portfolio site project I was assigned in the Skillcrush course: "Break Into Tech Blueprint".
We were given the design files and then had to write the HTML/CSS with limited instructions. Then we also had to use the command line (I used Terminal) to create a repo on GitHub and push the files to it. It has my name on it but is not my actual portfolio :)
