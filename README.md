My portfolio site
This is the code for a portfolio site I created for myself. Right now I can't afford the yearly fee for hosting/domain services, so it's only available here.
I showcase projects that I completed for an online course I took from Skillcrush called "Break Into Tech" Blueprint:
--created my own "Holstee Manifesto", which required us to play around with the box model, floating, color theory, etc in CSS
--was given design files for a basic website and then had to code from scratch to match the example given
--created a mock portfolio site from design files and general instructions
