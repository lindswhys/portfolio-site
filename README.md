# portfolio-site
My portfolio site
This was the code for a portfolio site project I was assigned in the Skillcrush course: "Break Into Tech Blueprint".
We were given the design files and then had to write the HTML/CSS with limited instructions. Then we also had to use the command line (I used Terminal) to create a repo on GitHub and push the files to it.
